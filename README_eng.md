> SoloPi is a wireless, non-invasive testing tool for automatic Android software testing. The Beta version has 3 main features: real time recording, performance data analysis, convenient multi device testing.

## Features

### 1. Real time recording

SoloPi captures all actions performed during tesing sessions so that issues can be identified and resolved more quickly. The recording can be played on any devices. All these actions can be done on just one single phone.

### 2. Real time performance analysis

* SoloPi is able to record and show the app's performance data such as CPU, memory, internet speed while do the testing. The performance window with selected testing metrics will float on top. After testing, you can check each testing parameter with generated data graphs.

* Besides, SoloPi can change testing environment to simulate certain situations. For instance, slow down the internet speed to simulate a situation when the internet is bad while using the app.

* SoloPi also add a function to calculate app launch time. This tool to the most extent, shows the actual launch time. This calculator function can be incorporated with UI automatic tests by sending broadcast messages.
